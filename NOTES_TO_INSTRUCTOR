Because our client did not yet have a complete data set to request, our statistics section is sparser than we imagined in the project proposal. We list only the number of reports per day for the past 15 days.

When the project is expanded and the data set is complete we will also list more interesting statistics.

Feel free to check out our progress in the future at beesneeds.colorado.edu. The data collection website will go live there once it's entirely complete!
